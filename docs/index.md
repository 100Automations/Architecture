# 100 Automations Site Architecture for Development

Welcome to 100 Automations: a github nexus for open source development. 100 Automations was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby Gem.
In addition to the use of HTMl, CSS, and Javascript; Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), a template language written in Ruby.

100 Automations uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for a server.
You really only need to install Docker, be sure to become familiar with both Jekyll, and Liquid.
