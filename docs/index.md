    <h1>100 Automations Website Architecture</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the 100 Automations architecture documentation. There are several things you should know about the website before getting started.
        So here's a brief overview of the tools we use. In the next sections we will also cover how the files are structured and how to build components to add new content onto the website.
        The tools that we use to make the website run are HTML, SASS, Jekyll, and Docker.
