    <h1>100 Automations Site Architecture</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the 100 Automations architecture documentation. The 100 Automations website was built using
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, HTMl, CSS, and
        Javascript. Jekyll uses a templating language known as <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        100 Automations uses <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> for a server. You really
        only need to install Docker, be sure to become familiar with both Jekyll, and Liquid.
