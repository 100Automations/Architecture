##### `About/`

`index.html`:

```html
{% include About/about_one.html %}
{% include About/join_us.html %}
{% include About/acknowledgements.html %}

```

As you can see from the index file this page is built using three components.
The order in which we use our include statement is the order that these files are displayed on our page.

1. `about_one.html`
