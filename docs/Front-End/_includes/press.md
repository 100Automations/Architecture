##### `Press/`

`index.html`:

```html
{% include Press/press_action.html %}
{% include Press/wave.html %}
{% include Press/share_ato.html %}

```

This is the press page which only has two sections for content.
If you notice, there is also a `wave.html`: just like the home page.

The `press_action.html` is a page that contains all the links to navigate the `press-kit/`
