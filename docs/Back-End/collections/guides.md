#### `_guides/`

In addition to the front matter inside of a guide there is also markdown content.
This content is displayed accessing the default `content` property.

This file is viewable because our config.yml file states that the output of this file should be viewable.
There is also a layout under the same name that coordinates how each guide should be displayed.
