#### `_bios/`

If you are on the 100 Automations team, either building an automation or the website, you will be creating a bio.
Bios are like automations, they only contain front matter and contain no content in markdown.

This collection's files are viewable as an individual file and accessed through the default property `bio.url`.
This is done in the config.yml file: `output: true`.

Additionally there is a layout for each bio.
